# InstAL: The Institutional Action Language.
The Institutional Action Language (InstAL) is a tool for specifying, modelling and verifying electronic institutions.

At the heart of InstAL is Answer Set Programming - institutional definitions are compiled into Answer Set Prolog (AnsProlog.) That AnsProlog program is then solved in different ways based on what operations the user wishes to perform with the institution.

# Installation Instructions
Installation instructions are available in README.md

# Running InstAL
There are three executable InstAL scripts in this directory:
- instalsolve.py - for single shot solving.
- instalquery.py - for multi shot solving.
- instaltrace.py - for different ways of processing and representing InstAL's json output.

All three of these scripts have help functionality. Append "--help" to the script on the command line.
